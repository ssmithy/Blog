## Hello, World!


### About me

Hi! I'm a software developer from UK!

I have over 15 years commercial experience writing and delivering software that's reduced company spend and increased efficiency. 
My fortes are backend development and solution architecture.

Websites, desktop applications, mobile apps. C#, Python, TypeScript. It's important to select the right tool for the job but it's also important to use the tools correctly.
That's why I'm almost obsessed with continuously improving my development practices and patterns to build more scalable and extensible software.
